We’re looking for ideas for a 13.1 sticker for the Marine Corps Half Marathon… can’t use the USMC Eagle, Globe & Anchor and the sticker needs to carry a tourism message consistent with our brand.
 
Message Considerations:
 
I Ran with the Heroes
I Finished with a Hero’s Welcome
I Received a Hero’s Welcome
 
Design Considerations:
·         The Official shirts are pulling from the Marine Corps Blue
·         The red is considered “Blood” red. When it’s on the pants, it is considered the Blood Stripe.
·         The sword is used to separate the 1 and 2 for the Half Marathon
·         The sword is a powerful symbol to the Marines
·         We can’t use the official font of the Marine Corps, but we can be close
