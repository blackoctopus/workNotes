<p>sticker needs to carry a tourism message consistent with our brand.</p>

<h3 id="messageconsiderations:">Message Considerations:</h3>

<ul>
<li>I Ran with the Heroes</li>
<li>I Finished with a Hero’s Welcome</li>
<li>I Received a Hero’s Welcome</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designconsiderations:">Design Considerations:</h2>

<ol>
<li>The Official shirts are pulling from the Marine Corps Blue</li>
<li>The red is considered “Blood” red. When it’s on the pants, it is considered the Blood Stripe.</li>
<li>The sword is used to separate the 1 and 2 for the Half Marathon</li>
<li>The sword is a powerful symbol to the Marines</li>
<li>We can’t use the official font of the Marine Corps, but we can be close</li>
</ol>
