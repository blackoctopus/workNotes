# We’re Looking for Ideas for a 13.1 Sticker for the Marine Corps Half Marathon… Can’t Use the USMC Eagle, Globe & Anchor #

sticker needs to carry a tourism message consistent with our brand.
 
###Message Considerations:
 
- I Ran with the Heroes
- I Finished with a Hero’s Welcome
- I Received a Hero’s Welcome
 
##Design Considerations:
1. The Official shirts are pulling from the Marine Corps Blue
2. The red is considered “Blood” red. When it’s on the pants, it is considered the Blood Stripe.
3. The sword is used to separate the 1 and 2 for the Half Marathon
4. The sword is a powerful symbol to the Marines
5. We can’t use the official font of the Marine Corps, but we can be close
